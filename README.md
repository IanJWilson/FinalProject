Controls--

Ninja Frog – This is the character the player controls. Using the left, right, and up arrow keys the player can make the frog move left and right as well as jump. By default, the frog can jump high enough to go up one block and run fast enough to cross a gap of one block without falling. 

Enemies--

VR headset man – An enemy that simply walks back and forth. Jumping on his head will kill him but touching him from any other direction will kill the player. 
 

Vodoo mask man – An enemy that stands still and shoots “bullets” at set intervals of time. These bullets will kill the player if they touch the player. Jumping on his head will kill him but touching him from any other direction will kill the player. 
 

Pink Finn from adventure time – An enemy that flies around and teleports to set location in pattern. Jumping on his head will kill him but touching him from any other direction will kill the player. Simply standing above him as he flies into your feet will still kill the player, as they are not jumping. 

Power-Ups--
 

Kiwi – A power up that lets the player jump high enough to get up two blocks. 

 
Apple – A power up that lets the player move fast enough to cover gaps of multiple blocks without falling. 


Banana – A power up that gives the player a shield. As long as they have the shield the next enemy the player touches from any direction that would normally kill the player will instead kill the enemy and remove the shield from the player.
